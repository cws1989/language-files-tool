# Language Files Tool #

> Language Files Tool is discontinued.

## Scenarios ##
  1. When you are doing a software and it's almost done, suddenly, your boss told you besides English, you have to support two more languages.
  1. I just make a tiny change to the code, the time that I spent to find and edit the language files needs much more time than I need to change the code.
  1. I hate looking at those language files abbreviation in the source code when I developing the software, sometimes the meaning of the abbre dun match with the actual string it stored in the language files, gosh!
  1. My boss said you should combine those similar sentences to one.

You faced these problems? If you need more than [gettext](http://www.gnu.org/s/gettext/), I think this might be the one you need.
